# Mobile-Forensics-Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates mobile forensics techniques for extracting, preserving, and analyzing data from Android devices using open-source tools.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** – Data extraction & device communication
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic capture & analysis
- **MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)** – APK analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Autopsy** – Forensic analysis of extracted files

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Wireshark** – Captured HTTPS/DNS traffic via USB tethering.
2. **ADB Logcat** – Extracted real-time logs, app activity, and system events.
3. **MobSF** – Performed static analysis on APK files.
4. **Autopsy** – Analyzed media, contacts, messages, and app artifacts.
